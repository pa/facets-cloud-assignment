# facets-cloud-assignment

This repo contains solutions for two tasks,

1. Create a `blue-app` and  `green-app` deployment. Expose it via an internal Service. Use nginx ingress controller to expose an http endpoint which routes 75% of the calls to blue app and 25% of the calls to green-app. For more details check [here](task-one/)

2. `Stretch goal` Automate the [task-one](task-one/) using terraform but with applications read from a json. For more details check [here](task-two--strech-goal/)
